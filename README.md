# Hi, I’m Otis Powell

AI & Energy Data Engineer working on production-grade data pipelines, automation, and interactive dashboards for decision support.

## What I Do

* Build end-to-end data workflows: ingestion (APIs), cleaning, feature engineering, and analytics
* Develop ML prototypes for classification and forecasting, then package them into usable tools
* Create interactive data visualizations and dashboards with Streamlit + Plotly
* Turn messy datasets into clear stories: charts, scoring models, and exportable outputs

## Tech Stack

* **Languages:** Python, ([GitHub][1])
* **Data & ML:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras ([GitHub][2])
* **Visualization:** Plotly, Streamlit, Matplotlib ([GitHub][3])
* **Web:** Django, HTML/CSS ([GitHub][4])
* **Tools:** Git, Jupyter, VS Code, Docker ([GitHub][3])

## Selected Work

* **TravelTiming (Streamlit + Plotly + OpenAI + Open-Meteo):** travel recommendation app with scoring algorithm, API-driven climate data, and interactive visualizations ([GitHub][3])
* **Powdery Mildew Detection (ML + Streamlit):** real-time image classification dashboard, deployed as a live app ([GitHub][2])
* **Django Travel Blog:** full-stack app with authentication, Cloudinary media uploads, and PostgreSQL support ([GitHub][4])

## Current Focus

Building more robust analytics and visualization patterns for climate and energy datasets, with an emphasis on reusable pipeline components and dashboard-first delivery.
